Problem statement: Pet Classification Model Using CNN.
Description
Project Objective:

Build a CNN model that classifies the given pet images correctly into dog and cat images. 
The project scope document specifies the requirements for the project “Pet Classification Model Using CNN.” Apart from specifying the functional and non-functional requirements for the project, it also serves as an input for project scoping. 

Project Description and Scope: 

You are provided with a collection of images of pets, that is, cats and dogs. These images are of different sizes with varied lighting conditions and they should be used as inputs for your model.
You are expected to write the code for CNN image classification model using TensorFlow that trains on the data and calculates the accuracy score on the test data.
